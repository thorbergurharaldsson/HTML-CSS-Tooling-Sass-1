## HTML & CSS - Tooling/SCSS - First assignment redone with scss

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kqN4hl9bGc&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jxJX7vojNVK-o8ubDZEcNb&index=1) to learn SCSS and when done I went through all the code to comment it to make sure I understood what the code was doing and how it works.

After I did this tutorial I re-did [my first assignment](https://github.com/thorbergurharaldsson/html-css-introductory-courses/tree/main/html-css-introduction) using SCSS for styling.

The redone assignment can be viewed here:
